            <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p>When you first start Mobile Legends, you’ll have to play through some tutorials. The opening tutorials are a GOOD idea to complete. Others tutorials are in the “not so much” category!! But once those are done OR if you’ve found a way to skip them you’ll be at the main screen showing below.</p>

          <td>
            <p>Those little red dots you see are indicators to let you know that you either have something to set, check out, or collect. So do yourself a favor and look into them as soon as possible!! For example, the Daily Quests as showing below. Go earn and get your rewards!!</p>

          <td>
            <p>If you have skipped certain tutorials, you can and really should complete them. You can find them by clicking the Prep button found in the bottom left of the main screen. Each of these 3 tutorials you complete provides a certain amount of Battle Points (BP). BP is used to buy various things from the Shop.</p>

            <h2>The Game Modes</h2>
            <p>You can access the Game Modes by clicking on the center map as showing in the main screen above. Each mode will unlock as you level. By the time you reach level 8, every game mode will be available. There’s a tutorial for each game mode when it unlocks. The “Coming Soon” should be pretty obvious!!</p>

            <p>You have fully customizable controls AND a default set of controls ready to go. You can change the default controls any which way you like. The recommendation is to leave them in their current positions.</p>

            <h2>The Heroes Screen</h2>
            <p>In here you’ll find all the heroes Mobile Legends has available. When you click on a hero, you can get detailed information about that hero. If you look at the upper middle area of the screen, you’ll see a drop down list for sorting. In the Shop, there’s an option to display only “Owned” heroes. But if something isn’t owned in the Heroes screen, you can buy it there. Prior to buying a hero, you can check out its skills. The recommendation is to go easy on spending when you’re first starting out. Try out various heroes first to see what you like playing with. Do note you’ll gain heroes via rewards too!! Of HIGH RECOMMENDATION is to take the time to read and understand the hero skill descriptions.</p>

            <p>When you click the Guides button in the bottom left of a hero screen, you can get specific information about the hero. As showing in the screen shot below, you scroll down a little bit and you can see there’s skill build recommendations. If you scroll down further, you’ll see item builds for the character and a win rate according to that item build which could be very helpful.</p>

            <p>These are skills which are unlocked via leveling. While using BlueStacks, the default trigger key is “F”. In the Prep section and before a match starts, you can set the Battle Spell to whichever one you’d like to use.</p>
